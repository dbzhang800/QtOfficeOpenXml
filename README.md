## Introduction

Qt Office Open Xml is a library that can be used to read and write opc packages,
such as .xlsx/.docx/.pptx files. It doesn't require
Microsoft Office and can be used in any platform that **Qt 5.2** or newer supported.

## Getting Started

### Building the module

> **Note**: Perl is needed in this step.

* Download the source code.

* Put the source code in any directory you like

* Run following command at the toplevel directory of the project:

|                    | Windows Qt MINGW           | Windows Qt MSVC     |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| ```qmake```        | ```qmake```                | ```qmake```         |
| ```make```         | ```mingw32-make```         | ```nmake```         |
|                    | ```mingw32-make check```   | ```nmake check```   |
| ```make install``` | ```mingw32-make install``` | ```nmake install``` |


The library, the header files, and others will be installed to your system.

### Using the module

* Add following line to your qmake's project file:

```
    QT += officeopenxml
```

* Then, using Qt Office Open XML in your code

## Source code directories

Maybe useful for users and contributors.

#### ```global\```

Globals files requried by all over the library.

#### ```mce\```

Depends on ```global``` only.

MCE (Markup Compatibility and Extensibility)

More information for mce can be found in ISO/IEC 29500:3.

key features of MCE?

* Alternative Content Blocks [Done]
* Ignorable and "must understand" namespaces [Done]
* ProcessContents [Done]
* Application-defined extension elements [Todo, wait for next version of ISO/IEC 29500?]
* Namespace subsumption [Won't support, seems they will be dropped by next ISO/IEC 29500?]
* ...

#### ```opc\```

Depends on ```global``` and ```mce```.

OPC (Open Packaging Conventions)

More information for opc can be found in ISO/IEC 29500:2.

As .xlsx, .pptx, .docx are all examples of opc package, user can do many interesting things using opc:

* **Create a simple .xlsx, .pptx or .docx document from scratch.** See example ```opc_create_package```
* **View the internal raw files of opc package.** See example ```opc_package_viewer``` and ```opc_extract_package```
* **Find the deference of two opc packages.** See example ```opc_packages_diff```
 * Create an Book1.xlsx file with Excel.
 * Do something for Book1.xlsx in Excel, then save it as Book2.xlsx
 * Open Book1.xlsx and Book2.xlsx using ```opc_packages_diff``` to find what happened.
* **Edit an existing opc package directly.** See example ```opc_package_xml_edit```
 * Open an Test.xlsx file generated by Excel
 * Edit the internal xml file of Test.xlsx directly, then save it again.
 * Re-open the Test.xlsx in Excel to find out what happened.

#### ```ooxml\```

Depends on ```global```, ```mce``` and ```opc```.

Shared files for Office Open XML Parts: ```dml```, ```wml```,```sml``` and ```pml```.

More information can be found in ISO/IEC 29500:1 and ISO/IEC 29500:4.

#### ```dml\```

Depends on ```global```, ```mce```, ```opc``` and ```ooxml```.

DML (DrawingML)

#### ```sml\```

Depends on ```global```, ```mce```, ```opc```, ```ooxml``` and ```dml```.

SML (SpreadsheetML)

#### ```wml\```

Depends on ```global```, ```mce```, ```opc```, ```ooxml``` and ```dml```.

WML (WordprocessingML)

#### ```pml\```

Depends on ```global```, ```mce```, ```opc```, ```ooxml``` and ```dml```.

PML (PresentionML)
